# Background  

Hello,  

My name is Gomathy Sankar K. Welcome to my portfolio. A little introduction about me. I did my undergraduate at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur and majored in Mechanical Engineering. I am very much interested in the data science field and constantly learning new concepts and techniques in the data science field.  
I have done several projects in data science using Python programming language, R programming language and Tableau software. I have a very good coding experience in Python and R programming languages and good experience in using Tableau software.  
One of my greatest achievements includes creating a shiny web application in R for text prediction application using NLP framework which is used for predicting the next word based on the given set of words as input from the user.  
Another achievement includes designing a MATLAB application for performing heat transfer analysis right from scratch that can perform well on different materials and models.

This repository holds all of my personal projects that I had done till now. All of my projects are divided into 3 categories.  

1. [Python Programming Language]()
2. [R Programming Language]()  
3. [Tableau Public]()  

Each of these categories has different types of projects included in them and are accompanied by some description of those projects.
